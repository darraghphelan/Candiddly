This application is part of my submission for my final year project. It is a candid photo sharing application 
developed in Kotlin using Android Studio. The report submitted with the link will detail the finer points of 
the project. This is a simple user guide for those testing the functionality of the application.

1. Login and Registration is the same as a standard application. It will ask for an email address and password
as well as a username for registration.

2. To take and send photographs with the application, tap the floating camera button at the bottom right 
of the main screen. This will take you to a list of friends you can choose to send the photograph to. When 
you tap on the cell it will take you to the camera screen. The capture button will take a picture and 
immediately send it to the recipient you chose on the previous screen. The sender does not get to choose 
which pictures are sent, all of them are.

3. To view your connections i.e. your lists of friends, your sent friend requests and received friends
request, tap the hamburger icon at the top left of the main screen and choose 'Connections'. 

4. You can add friends by entering their usernames in the text field and tapping the 'Add friend' button.
Refreshing the page by dragging down will update the appropriate lists.

5. To start an event, every user must choose the 'Start and Event' button after pressing the hamburger icon
and one user must be designated as the host. This person adds all the usernames and pressing the 'Add!' 
button after each one. When the host is finished, they must hit the 'Start' button. Every group member must 
then go to the 'Discover my friend' section to see who they must take a candid photograph of for the event.

6. To view the photographs others have sent you, choose the 'View Your Pictures' option after pressing the
hamburger icon. If there are images to view then they will appear, else it will be a blank screen. Cycle 
through the list by hitting the 'Next' button and 'Save the images to a dedicated folder using the 'Save'
button.

To aid in testing some of the applications features four accounts have been made. Certain features require
your own account, however. 

These accounts are:
Email: a@a.com
Password: 12345678
Username: Alpha

Email: b@b.com
Password: 12345678
Username: Beta

Email: d@d.com
Password: 12345678
Username: Doodle

Email: g@g.com
Password: 12345678
Username: Grand

The Alpha account has some friend requests sent, received and accepted while the others have none.
